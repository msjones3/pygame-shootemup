# PYGAME - Shoot 'em up!
This is the starter code for a space-invader-style game. 
## Get Started
- download this repository
- open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- in the terminal, install Pygame by typing `pip install pygame` 
- run the program by typing `python shmup-2.py` in the terminal

## Study the starter code
To start, let's have a look at the starter code you have been given `shmup-2.py`  
Identify what is happening at each of these parts:
- imports
- declaring variables
- initializing pygame and creaing the window
- What is the class Player?
- The class Player has 2 functions - an init function and an update function. What are each of them for? 
- Who does the class Mob represent? 
- compare the movement and speed of the player to the movement and speed of the mob. What is the difference? Check this against the speed and movement when you run the program. 
- examine the game loop. What functions are being called? 
- when does the function `pygame.quit()` get called?
